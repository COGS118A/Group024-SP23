# Group024-SP23

This repository contains the code and data for the project "Classification of Mitochondrial Morphology Types: Comparative Analysis of Novel and Established Machine Learning Methodologies." The project aims to develop novel classification models for accurately identifying mitochondrial morphology types and compare them against a baseline approach. The classification models are evaluated based on their accuracy in classifying three distinct classes of mitochondria: punctate, swollen, and networked.

### Data
The microscopy data used in this project was obtained from the publication "Deep Analysis of Mitochondria and Cell Health Using Machine Learning." The dataset consists of features obtained from microscopy images involving the application of various drug conditions. The dataset includes samples representing three distinct classes of mitochondria: punctate, swollen, and networked.

### Installation
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the folder in which you wish to install the repository
```
cd /path
```
2. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/COGS118A/Group024-SP23.git
```

### Usage
To reproduce the experiments and run the classification models, open the Jupyter Notebook file FinalProject_Group024-SP23.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. The notebook contains detailed instructions and code for training and evaluating the classification models.

### Results
The results of the comparative evaluation between the baseline and novel classification models are presented in the Jupyter Notebook file FinalProject_Group024-SP23.ipynb. The classification accuracy rates for each model are reported, providing insights into the proficiency of the models in accurately classifying mitochondrial morphology types.
