    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate classification of mitochondrial morphology types is crucial for understanding cellular health and function. In this study, we employ an established methodology to classify mitochondria morphology and propose novel classification models for comparison against the baseline approach. Our analysis utilizes microscopy data obtained from the publication \"Deep Analysis of Mitochondria and Cell Health Using Machine Learning,\" which captured images following a standardized procedure involving the application of various drug conditions. Consequently, three distinct classes of mitochondria were identified: punctate, swollen, and networked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline methodology encompasses training a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model (k=5) and a naive Bayes classifier, leveraging pre-engineered features outlined in the aforementioned publication. To ascertain the efficacy of these models, we conduct a comparative evaluation with support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, ensembles, and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Evaluation is based on the classification accuracy rate, enabling a comprehensive assessment of each model's proficiency in accurately classifying mitochondrial morphology types.\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing a comprehensive comparison between established and novel methodologies, this study aims to contributes to the advancement of mitochondrial research and its implications for cellular health and function."

    "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that create ATP and regulate cellular processes. It contributes in the regulation of cell fate, homeostasis, survival, disease in eukaryotic cells. The phenotypes of mitochondria are variable, meaning that they can have different physical characteristics. In \"Deep Analysis of Mitochondria and Cell Health Using Machine Learning\", they attempted to classify different morphological classes of mitochondria: punctate, swollen, and networked. These different classes can observe different characteristics. Abnormal morphological dynamics can be indicative of disease. Due to the importance of this organelle, there is a need for fast and accurate methods of mitochondria morphology classification. The amount of data acquired usually requires carefull examination, but due to the large amounts is impossible to analyze by humans. Cutting edge technology utilized machine learning techniques to get the most out of biological data. With the assistance of machine learning, we can become more adept at diagnosing patients or doing drug discovery.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Advancements in machine learning hold great promise for revolutionizing the field of biology and medicine by unlocking the untapped potential of understanding human health. In this study, we aim to address a critical challenge in early medical diagnosis and drug discovery by employing machine learning algorithms to classify mitochondria morphology based on features extracted from microscopy images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitochondria, dynamic organelles that govern numerous cellular processes, have emerged as a primary focus of research due to their crucial role in regulating cellular health. Early changes in mitochondrial structure and function are indicative of underlying cellular health conditions. Thus, characterizing these changes can provide valuable insights into the development of effective diagnostic methods and targeted therapeutic interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this problem, we conducted an extensive literature review and identified a seminal paper entitled \"Deep Analysis of Mitochondria and Cell Health Using Machine Learning\" as the basis for our study. Building upon the core concepts presented in this paper and leveraging knowledge acquired in our class, we strive to develop robust machine learning models to accurately classify mitochondria morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the replicability of our findings, we will meticulously follow a systematic approach. Firstly, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on our datasets, examining their structure, characteristics, and underlying details. This exploratory step will enable us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, identify any potential dependencies or relationships, and inform subsequent modeling decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a baseline, we will train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and a naive Bayes model using the extracted features. These models will serve as benchmarks against which the performance of subsequent models will be evaluated. We will meticulously assess the performance of these baseline models, considering metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the baseline models, we will explore and train additional machine learning models to further enhance the classification accuracy. These models may include but are not limited to Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks. By evaluating and comparing the performance of these models against the baseline approaches, we aim to identify the most effective methodology for classifying mitochondria morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on studying the variations in performance among machine learning models when applied to biological applications. Through this comparative analysis, we aim to provide insights into the suitability and efficacy of different machine learning approaches for accurate mitochondria morphology classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "By elucidating the disparities in performance between these models, our study will contribute to advancing the understanding of the application of machine learning in biology."
